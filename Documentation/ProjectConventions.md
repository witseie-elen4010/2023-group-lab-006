# Code style guidelines
1. All variables should have meaningful names. Eg: isNum would be a boolean
2. All functions should be named meanignfully and should describe the output of the function.
3. Use camelCase in naming variables or functions.
4. Start the names of all files, functions and variables with lowercase letters. 
5. Blocks of code should be indented by 4 spaces. 
6. General rules for complex (compound) statements:
	- Put the opening bracket at the end of the first line.
	- Use one space before the opening bracket.
	- Put the closing bracket on a new line, without leading spaces.
7. All mathematical operators should have a space on either side. Eg: 4 + 4 = 8
8. All commas and semicolons should be followed by one space unless at the end of a line.
9. Avoid excessively long lines of code (>100 character length). Rather separate the code across multiple lines.

# Code review guidelines
1. Review names and whether they are meaningful or not
2. Check for bugs and that the code runs
3. Check for duplicate code that could rather be plced into a method instead
4. Check for tests and review these tests too.
5. Comment changes made or recommended changes to the code in the review process
